          I don&apos;t have the ability to test this, but I believe you can
          export your save file to a USB drive, then rename the file to
          <BaseCode>profile.sav</BaseCode> and import. If you can confirm this
          works, please use the blue bug report icon in the bottom right to get
          in touch.

          I could use some help with this one. If you know where the save is, or
          can provide a save that I can test with, I will happily try to make
          this work. Please use the blue bug report icon in the bottom right to
          get in touch.
