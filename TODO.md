# TODO

- Add CHANGELOG: `Linked Builds link removed from user profiles. This can still be found by manually adding /linked-builds at the end of your profile link. This feature is no longer officially supported.`
- When build is added to a collection, it does not error when build is already in collection until page is reloaded.
- Add page to view specific collection
- Add page to edit specific collection
- Check to make sure deleting a collection does not delete the builds in it
