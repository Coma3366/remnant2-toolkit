# TODO

- Add CHANGELOG: `Linked Builds link removed from user profiles. This can still be found by manually adding /linked-builds at the end of your profile link. This feature is no longer officially supported.`
- Add edit logic to build collections page
  - Need to be able to change build name and description (probably just a dialog)
- Add moderation hooks around build names and descriptions
- Ensure build collection descriptions limited to 500 characters (constant already set)
